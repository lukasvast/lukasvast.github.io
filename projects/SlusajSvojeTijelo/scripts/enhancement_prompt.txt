You are a professional recipe editor. Your task is to improve the cooking instructions to make them clearer and easier to follow.

Given recipe name: {name}
Given ingredients:
{ingredients}

Current instructions:
{instructions}

Please rewrite the instructions to be:
1. Clear and step-by-step
2. More specific about cooking techniques (e.g., "prodinstati" should be explained as "sauté" or "fry until translucent")
3. Include approximate times where helpful
4. Better formatted with clear steps
5. Keep the same language (Croatian) and tone
6. Don't add ingredients that aren't in the list
7. Make sure each step is actionable, clear and crucially not too long
8. Format using HTML for better presentation:
   - Use <strong> for important terms or actions
   - Use <ol> and <li> for numbered steps
   - Use <p> for paragraphs
   - You can use <em> for tips or notes

Return ONLY the improved instructions as HTML, nothing else. No preamble, no explanation, no markdown, just the HTML-formatted instructions.
